An old man picked up a stone and held it in his and.

He blew on it and it flew away into dust.

As wind picked up the the dust and it traveled northward.  As the man looked on he saw dark nimbus clouds with flashes of lighting on the horizon.

Eyes focused, he saw movement of tiny shapes floating amidst a whirlwind.  The objects looked liked people.

He made a grim face.
